### I am Xinyu(Yuki) Shen

I am an aspiring data scientist passionate about uncovering insights through statistical modeling and machine learning. I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Florida, pursuing a double major in Data Science and Economics with a minor in Mathematics.

My work spans academic research, analytics competitions, and independent projectsâ€”each deepening my experience in programming with Python and R, and using tools like R Shiny, SAS, and Excel to explore and visualize complex data. I am particularly drawn to applying data science methods to solve real-world problems, whether through predictive modeling, exploratory analysis, or interactive dashboards.

I am also committed to producing clear, reproducible work and enjoy using tools like RMarkdown and Quarto to document and share my analyses with clarity and transparency.

If I could describe myself using three emojis, I would choose: ðŸ“ŠðŸ§ â˜•
